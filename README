JT Stanley - Environment

This is just a test for a 3-dimensional first-person platforming environment.
The renderer is written using the OpenGL fixed-function pipeline, so it will actually compile on older systems and Windows computers.

Modern OpenGL would be a lot better..

Controls : Left and Right arrow keys to look around.
	   WASD keys for movement.
