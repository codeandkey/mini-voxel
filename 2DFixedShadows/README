JT Stanley - 2DFixedShadows

This is an implementation of my 2D shadowing algorithm using the fixed function pipeline.
It does all of the shadow calculation on the CPU, which are not very intensive.
The calculations are simple vertex extrusions with reverse trianlgulations to the original sides.

This implementation is cross-platform and should work on any system with OpenGL 1.1+.
If your computer is newer than 1998, you will definitely be able to compile and execute this with at least a software renderer.

Dependencies : GLFW3, GLEW, GL, GLU
Also depends on <algorithm> and the legacy standard C++ library.

There are variable definitions in Defaults.h which can be configured to change the output of the program.
